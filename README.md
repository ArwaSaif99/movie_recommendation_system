Introduction

With the growing amount of content available online, users often find it challenging to choose movies that match their preferences. Recommendation systems help mitigate this issue by suggesting personalized options based on user data and patterns. This project focuses on a collaborative filtering approach using the ALS algorithm to deliver tailored movie suggestions.

Algorithm
The Movie Recommendation System utilizes the Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm, which decomposes the user-item rating matrix into latent features for users and items. By minimizing the least squares error, ALS predicts user preferences accurately.

Dataset
This project uses the MovieLens-32M dataset, which consists of user ratings for a diverse range of movies. The dataset is structured into several CSV files, including:

Ratings: User ratings for movies.
Movies: Metadata about the movies (titles, genres, etc.).
Tags: User-generated tags for additional metadata.
Links: Connections to external movie databases.
